            <h2>NICE</h2>
                <p2>Before everything else, there was the sea, and the Mediterranean climate – the twin factors that made Nice a tourist magnet as early as the 1700s. Look around and you’ll find the same elemental attractions that drew Europe's belle-époque aristocrats to promenade along the waterfront in horse-drawn carriages. Even now, nothing compares to the simple joy of a balmy beach day interspersed with a spot of people-watching astride the Promenade des Anglais' famous blue chairs. Whether you're skating, kayaking, swimming, sprawled on a beach lounger or transfixed by sunset over the ever-present Med, it's all still happening by the water.<br></p2>

                <p4><br>For any lover of French and Italian culture, Nice is the perfect hybrid. Long affiliated with Piedmont and Liguria to the east, Savoy to the north and Sardinia to the south, this city only joined France in 1860 and has always kept one foot in Italy. The Italian influence remains palpable everywhere, in Vieux Nice's tall-shuttered, ochre-hued buildings that look airlifted straight in from Portofino, in the fresh pasta shops on every corner and even in the football cheer Issa Nissa! (Go Nice!), shouted in the local Nissart dialect that’s been coloured by Ligurian Italian as much as Occitan French.</p4>

            <h2> HYERES </h2>
                <p4> Tell someone you're headed to a festival in the south of France, and they'll mention starlets on the Croisette. Say you're attending the Festival International des Arts de la Mode, and the conversation will grind to a halt. But this avant-garde fashion extravaganza, held in Hyères, a village on the Côte d'Azur, is the place to see the next style makers. John Galliano and Andrée Putman have served on the jury; the Dutch couturier team Viktor & Rolf and realist photographer Anuschka Blommers were discovered here. "You have all this creativity and, at the same time, a great long weekend in the sun," says French designer Martine Sitbon. "There's nothing else like it in fashion." The general public can reserve tickets to the events—which range from fashion shows to photography exhibitions—and visit the Modernist masterpiece Villa Noailles, fresh from a $3.5 million restoration </p4>

            <h2>LE PLAN-DE-LA TOUR</h2>
                <p4> Plan de la Tour is a little village surrounded by forests of pines and oaks, a wonderful spot for setting out on hikes.
                Plan de la Tour offers the tranquillity and charm of a village in the shade of plane trees, where a certain easygoing lifestyle is the rule. This village in the heart of the Maures massif is surrounded by natural beauty.</p4>
